A python file that translates audio and returns text to speech audio

# Motive
During a club fair, someone brought to my attention that some immigrants may have problems communicating or going to school because of language barriers.
This is a solution to help the community understand one another, possibly weakening the barrier for those who have issues with getting used to a new environment.

# Installation
You can download the repository and run the python file itself.
